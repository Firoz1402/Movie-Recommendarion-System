# Movie-Recommendarion-System
Description:

Welcome to the "Movie Recommendation System with Cosine Similarity - IMDB Dataset" repository. This project presents a movie recommendation system that leverages the power of cosine similarity, a fundamental technique in natural language processing (NLP). We've harnessed the rich IMDb dataset and applied standard NLP preprocessing techniques, including Bag of Words (BoW) vectorization, to create a robust recommendation system.

# Introduction to Cosine Similarity:

Cosine similarity is a widely used metric for measuring the similarity between two vectors in a high-dimensional space. In the context of NLP and text analysis, it's often used to compare the similarity of documents or, in this case, movie descriptions.

The cosine similarity between two vectors A and B is calculated using the following formula:

cosine_similarity(A, B) = (A • B) / (||A|| * ||B||)
Where:

A • B represents the dot product of vectors A and B.
||A|| and ||B|| represent the Euclidean norms (magnitudes) of vectors A and B, respectively.
How Cosine Similarity Measures Distance:

Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors. Here's what happens mathematically:

If the angle between vectors A and B is 0 degrees (perfect alignment), their cosine similarity is 1.
If the angle is 90 degrees (perpendicular), the cosine similarity is 0.
If the angle is 180 degrees (perfect opposition), the cosine similarity is -1.
In essence, the cosine similarity quantifies the degree of similarity between two vectors, with values ranging from -1 (completely dissimilar) to 1 (completely similar). Values closer to 1 indicate a higher degree of similarity, while values closer to -1 indicate dissimilarity.

# Project Details:

In this repository, we have implemented a movie recommendation system using cosine similarity on movie descriptions. Here's an overview of the project:

Data Collection: We've utilized the IMDb dataset, which contains a vast collection of movie information, including titles, descriptions, genres, and more.

Data Preprocessing: To prepare the text data for analysis, we've applied standard NLP preprocessing techniques, such as:

Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words or tokens.
Stopword Removal: Eliminating common, non-informative words (e.g., "the," "and").
Lowercasing: Converting all text to lowercase for consistency.
Bag of Words (BoW) Vectorization: Creating numerical representations of movie descriptions.
Cosine Similarity Calculation: We've computed the cosine similarity between movie descriptions using the BoW vectors. This step quantifies the similarity between movies based on their textual content.

# Recommendation Engine:
With the cosine similarity matrix in hand, our recommendation engine can suggest movies similar to a user's input. Users can provide a movie title, and the system will find and recommend movies with the highest cosine similarity scores.


User Interface: For user-friendliness, we've designed a simple interface for users to interact with the recommendation system.

This repository offers a comprehensive view of how to build a movie recommendation system using cosine similarity, a fundamental NLP technique. Whether you're interested in movie recommendations, NLP, or data science, this project provides valuable insights and a practical example of cosine similarity's application.
